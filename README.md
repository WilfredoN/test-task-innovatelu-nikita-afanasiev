## This repository contains the implementation of the Document Management System using Java language with Gradle builder.

### Features:
> - Save documents into HashMap storage containing id and the Document class itself.
> - Search documents by id.
> - Search documents that are matched by SearchRequest fields.

### Ideas of improvement:
> - I tried to realize the task without extra methods, but search() method can be improved by separating the SearchRequest fields matching logic.

#### Example of working with the DocumentManager shown in Main class.
